# terraform-aws-deployment

In this project, I deployed rancher k3s, which is a lighter version of Kubernetes, using Terraform and AWS Cloud9. I also provisioned a three tier architecure within AWS
using the following services: Elastic Compute Cloud (ec2), Virtual Private Cloud (vpc), Elastic Load Balancer (elb), security groups and the internet gateway. The end 
result is a fully functioning and accessible Kubernetes cluster.
